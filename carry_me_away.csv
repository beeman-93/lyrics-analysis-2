carry_me_away,"[Verse 1]I'm such a bore, I'm such a bummerThere must be more behind the summerI want someone to make some troubleBeen way too safe inside my bubble, ohTake me out and keep me up all nightLet me live on the wilder side of the light[Chorus]Carry me awayCarry me awayCarry me awayCarry me awayCarry me awayCarry me away[Verse 2]You carnivore, you loose cannonCan I have some more? I can't understand itYou fast car, you foolish spenderYou know you are, and I surrenderSo come on over and wake me upPut some of your tequila in my coffee cupYou know I need you, and that's for sureYou're just the kinda crazy I've been lookin' for[Chorus]Carry me awayCarry me awayCarry me away(Where the sun hits my face all different)Carry me awayCarry me awayCarry me away"
