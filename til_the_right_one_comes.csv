til_the_right_one_comes,"[Verse 1]Well the lucky in love called themselves winnersAnd losers are sinners who have gone astrayAs if I woke up lonely one morningLooked around and decided I would stay that way[Chorus]You knock me down and you call me crazyYou say I'm never gonna love someoneGive it time now and you might find maybeI'll prove you wrong when the right one comesWon't be long til the right one comes[Verse 2]And I know people broke down and defeatedLost what they needed in some miserable warSo forgive me if I might look around for a minuteBefore jumping right in it, I just want to be sure[Chorus]Some people 'round here been calling me crazySome people say I'll never love someoneThat's alright, give it time and maybeI prove you wrong when the right one comesWon't be long til the right one comes[Verse 3]Now I'm lying in my bed, the end of a long dayHeaded the wrong way down that highway of dreamsWhen you're little unsure of what you're headed forThe end of the road ain't as close as it seems[Chorus]Some people 'round here been calling me crazy""Must be something he's been running from""Stick around now and you might find maybeProve you wrong when the right one comesWon't be long til the right one comesTil the right one comesTil the right one comes[Outro]Who's that knocking at my doorIs it someone I've been looking forAnd who's that throwing arms around meAnd telling me she finally found meTil the right one comesTil the right one comesTil the right one comesTil the right one comesTil the right one comes"
