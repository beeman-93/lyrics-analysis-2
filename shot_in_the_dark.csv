shot_in_the_dark,[Verse 1]It's a hard runLoving like we doTakes way too long to get over youAnd remember the line we drewBut call me over and I'm coming through[Chorus]We're searching for the night togetherWhere we don't fall apartMight be now and it might be neverIt's just another shot in the darkIt's just another shot in the dark[Verse 2]And I wonder what it all meansStrange conversation with you in my dreamsAnd I don't know what I'm gonna doI've loved seven other women and thеy all were you[Chorus]We had a run of bad romancеsThey always missed the markSo close your eyes now and take your chancesIt's just another shot in the darkIt's just another shot in the dark[Bridge]I want you in the worst wayIs the gate code still your birthday[Chorus]If you thought you met your CasanovaAnd he left you with a broken heartRemember when it's done and overIt was only just a shot in the darkIt was only just a shot in the darkIt's just another shot in the darkIt's just another shot in the dark
