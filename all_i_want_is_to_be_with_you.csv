all_i_want_is_to_be_with_you,"[Verse 1]I can fake it and pretendI don’t wanna see your face againAnd I can find me someone newBut all I want is to be with you[Verse 2]I can learn how to let you goAnd carry on with the one man showI’ll fade away into the blueBut all I want is to be with youAll I want is to be with you[Verse 3]I’ll get dressed and hit the town tonightMeet some faces under neon lightsI dance alone with deja-vuBut all I want is to be with youAll I want is to be with you[Verse 4]They said I’d hurt you, said I’d runJust like I always do with everyoneBut you were different I was trueAnd all I want is to be with youAll I want is to be with youAll I want is to be with you[Outro]All I want isAll I want isAll I want isAll I want isAll I want isAll I want is"
