i_guess_i_just_feel_like,"[Verse 1]I guess I just feel likeI guess I just feel likeNobody's honest, nobody's trueEveryone's lyin' to make it on throughI guess I just feel like I'm the same way too[Interlude]Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh[Verse 2]I guess I just feel like good things are goneAnd the weight of my worries is too much to take onI think I remember the dream that I hadThat love's gonna save us from a world that's gone madI guess I just feel likeWhat happened to that?[Instrumental Break][Verse 3]I guess I just feel like the joke's gettin' oldAnd the future is fading and the past is on holdBut I know that I'm open and I know that I'm freeAnd I'll always let hope in wherever I'll beAnd if I go blind, I'd still find my wayI guess I just felt like givin' up today[Outro]Mmm, yeah, yeah"
