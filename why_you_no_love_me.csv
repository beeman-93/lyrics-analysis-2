why_you_no_love_me,"[Verse 1]Help me understand itWoke up empty-handedNever heard you say goodbyeDo you remember summer said she'd go foreverThen you turn as cold as the weatherAnd left me here to cry and cryTell me[Chorus]Why you no love me?Why you no love me?Why you no even care?Why you no love me?Why you no love me?Why you no will be there?[Verse 2]Shattered, come to find that none of it matteredEmpty like the promise you made meFlat out on the floor, oh noHurt me once, I let it beHurt me twice, you're dead to meThree times makes you familyWhy can't you see I'm yours?Tell me[Chorus]Why you no love me?Why you no love me? (Why you no love me?)Why you no even care?(Don't you know I want you? Ooh)Why you no love me? (Why you no love me?)Why you no love me? (Why you no love me?)Why you no will be there?[Instrumental Solo][Outro]Why you no love me?Why you no love me?Why you no even care?(Don't you know I want you? Ooh)Why you no love me? (Why you no love me, baby?)Why you no love me? (Why you no love me, girl?)Why you no will be there? (Why you no will be there?)Why you no will be?Why you no will be there?"
